## Documentation Structure

Each service directory contains:
- `README.md` - Main documentation (copy of official docs)
- `api.md` - API reference (if applicable)
- `architecture.md` - System design documentation
- `shaman-integration.md` - Shaman-specific integration details
- Additional files as provided by the upstream project

## Updating Documentation

To update external documentation:

1. Copy the latest documentation from the external project
2. Place files in the appropriate directory
3. Update `shaman-integration.md` with any integration changes
4. Note any breaking changes or new features that affect Shaman

The goal is to keep documentation as close to the original as possible to enable easy updates via copy-paste.
