# PROJECT STATUS

## Current State: Core Implementation Complete

### Overview

Shaman has successfully integrated Foreman for workflow orchestration and updated all critical components. The system now provides a complete agent execution pipeline with proper task management, LLM integration, and platform tools.

### Recent Accomplishments

1. **Foreman Integration Complete**
   - All workflow orchestration delegated to external Foreman service
   - Worker processes tasks from Foreman queues
   - Platform tools store run_data in Foreman
   - No internal BullMQ or workflow code

2. **Vercel AI SDK Updated**
   - Updated to latest v5.0.8
   - Provider packages updated: @ai-sdk/openai@2.0.5, @ai-sdk/anthropic@2.0.1
   - Fixed API compatibility issues with new SDK structure

3. **Worker Implementation**
   - Complete rewrite to directly execute agents
   - No circular A2A dependencies
   - Proper agent resolution from git and external sources
   - Integration with LLM providers and tool router

4. **Build System Fixed**
   - All 23 packages building successfully
   - Resolved "2" package dependency issue
   - Fixed TypeScript type mismatches
   - ESLint errors resolved

### Architecture

The system maintains a clean separation of concerns:

```
GraphQL Server (Management)     A2A Server (Execution)
     ‚îÇ                                ‚îÇ
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¨‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
                  ‚îÇ
            Foreman Service
          (Workflow Orchestration)
                  ‚îÇ
              Worker Process
           (Agent Execution)
```

### Key Components Status

#### ‚úÖ Fully Implemented

- Agent discovery and resolution
- Git-based agent caching
- LLM integration (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Platform tools (run_data operations)
- A2A protocol server
- GraphQL management API
- Worker with Foreman integration
- Database migrations and seeds
- Security (JWT, API keys)

#### üöß Partial Implementation

- MCP server integration (stub only)
- Observability (basic logging only)
- Integration tests (written, not running)

#### ‚ùå Not Implemented

- Permiso RBAC integration
- Ory Kratos authentication
- Client SDK
- Admin UI
- Agent marketplace

### Environment Requirements

```env
# Database
SHAMAN_DB_HOST=localhost
SHAMAN_DB_PORT=5432
SHAMAN_DB_NAME=shaman
RLS_DB_USER=rls_db_user
RLS_DB_USER_PASSWORD=<secure>
UNRESTRICTED_DB_USER=unrestricted_db_user
UNRESTRICTED_DB_USER_PASSWORD=<secure>

# Workflow Orchestration
FOREMAN_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3000
FOREMAN_API_KEY=fmn_dev_shaman_abc123

# Security
JWT_SECRET=<secure-secret>

# LLM Providers
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-key>

# Worker
INTERNAL_A2A_URL=http://localhost:5001
WORKER_CONCURRENCY=5
```

### Quick Start

1. **Setup Environment**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d  # PostgreSQL, Redis, Foreman
   ./build.sh --install  # Build all packages
   ```

2. **Initialize Database**

   ```bash
   npm run migrate:shaman:latest
   npm run seed:shaman:run
   ```

3. **Start Services**

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: GraphQL API
   cd node/packages/shaman-gql-server && npm start

   # Terminal 2: A2A Server
   cd node/packages/shaman-a2a-server && npm start -- --role public

   # Terminal 3: Worker
   cd node/packages/shaman-worker && npm start
   ```

### Next Steps

#### Immediate (MVP)

1. Test complete agent execution flow
2. Verify Foreman integration works end-to-end
3. Run integration test suite
4. Document agent creation process

#### Short Term

1. Implement proper JWT token generation in worker
2. Add retry logic and error recovery
3. Implement health checks
4. Add basic metrics collection

#### Long Term

1. Permiso RBAC integration
2. Client SDK development
3. Admin UI
4. Production deployment setup

### Known Issues

1. **JWT in Worker**: Currently uses raw secret instead of proper JWT generation
2. **MCP Client**: Only stub implementation
3. **Type Assertions**: Some areas still use `as` casts for types
4. **Integration Tests**: Need environment setup to run

### Development Notes

- This is an early-stage product - breaking changes are acceptable
- No migration concerns - can completely rewrite components
- Focus on getting core functionality working correctly
- Documentation should reflect current state, not aspirational features
