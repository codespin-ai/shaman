# Project Status - Shaman AI Agent Framework

This file is maintained for AI assistants to quickly understand the current state of the Shaman project when starting a new session.

## Quick Context
Shaman is a comprehensive backend framework for managing and coordinating AI agents through a federated ecosystem. It's built as a NodeJS/TypeScript monorepo without npm workspaces, using a custom build system.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Core Packages
1. **shaman-types** - Type definitions for entire system
2. **shaman-logger** - Centralized logging with context
3. **shaman-core** - Core utilities and base types
4. **shaman-config** - Configuration loading and validation
5. **shaman-llm-core** - LLM provider interface
6. **shaman-workflow-core** - Workflow engine abstraction
7. **shaman-persistence** - Database layer with pg-promise
8. **shaman-observability** - OpenTelemetry integration
9. **shaman-llm-vercel** - Vercel AI SDK implementation

### ✅ Completed Agent Infrastructure
10. **shaman-git-resolver** - Git-based agent discovery with caching
11. **shaman-external-registry** - External agent registry support
12. **shaman-agents** - Unified agent resolution
13. **shaman-a2a-provider** - A2A protocol implementation
14. **shaman-tool-router** - Tool execution routing
15. **shaman-agent-executor** - Agent execution engine
16. **shaman-workflow-temporal** - Temporal workflow adapter

### ✅ Completed Server
17. **shaman-server** - GraphQL API server with:
    - Express middleware setup
    - Apollo Server configuration (commented out, needs integration)
    - GraphQL schema and resolvers
    - Health endpoints
    - Basic structure for subscriptions (not implemented)

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented
18. **shaman-security** - Has structure but needs:
    - JWT validation implementation
    - RBAC policy enforcement
    - Rate limiting refinement
    
19. **shaman-workflow-bullmq** - Has adapter skeleton but needs:
    - Queue management
    - Job processing
    - Error handling

20. **shaman-worker** - Has bootstrap but needs:
    - Workflow processing logic
    - Agent execution integration
    - Queue consumers

21. **shaman-cli** - Has command structure but needs:
    - Command implementations
    - Server API integration

## Remaining Work Options

### shaman-security
**Current state**: Has basic structure but needs implementation
**Remaining tasks**:
- Implement JWT token validation
- Add RBAC middleware
- Complete rate limiting
- Add security context to GraphQL
**Dependencies**: Needed for authenticated API access

### shaman-workflow-bullmq
**Current state**: Has adapter skeleton
**Remaining tasks**:
- Set up BullMQ queues
- Implement workflow execution
- Add job monitoring
- Error handling and retries
**Dependencies**: Alternative to Temporal for workflow execution

### shaman-worker
**Current state**: Has bootstrap structure
**Remaining tasks**:
- Connect to workflow engine (BullMQ or Temporal)
- Implement agent execution jobs
- Add health monitoring
- Handle graceful shutdown
**Dependencies**: Requires workflow adapter (either Temporal or BullMQ)

### shaman-cli
**Current state**: Has command structure
**Remaining tasks**:
- Implement sync command
- Implement run command
- Add configuration management
- Add output formatting
**Dependencies**: Requires server API

### Server Enhancements
**Current state**: Basic server running, Apollo commented out
**Remaining tasks**:
- Enable Apollo Server integration
- Implement GraphQL subscriptions
- Add authentication middleware
- Integrate A2A gateway
**Dependencies**: May need security package for auth

## Current Blockers & Decisions Needed

1. **Apollo Server Integration**: Currently commented out in server. Need to uncomment and test once auth is ready.

2. **Database Migrations**: Need to verify all tables exist for new features (user, auth tokens, etc.)

3. **Environment Variables**: May need additional config for:
   - JWT secrets
   - Redis connection (for BullMQ)
   - Temporal connection details

## Important Implementation Notes

- All packages follow functional programming (no classes)
- Use Result<T, E> pattern for error handling
- Database queries use DbRow pattern with mappers
- All imports must use .js extension
- Follow the build order in build.sh when adding dependencies

## Session Start Checklist

When starting a new session:
1. Run `./build.sh` to ensure everything compiles
2. Check for any failing tests or lints
3. Ask the user what they'd like to work on from the remaining options
4. Reference CODING-STANDARDS.md for implementation patterns

## Recent Activity Log

- Fixed ESLint issues in shaman-server (all errors resolved)
- Converted promise.then() patterns to async/await where possible
- Created PROJECT_STATUS.md for session continuity
